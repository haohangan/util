On Unix/Linux:

javap -verbose MyClass | grep "major"

On Windows:

javap -verbose MyClass | findstr "major"

You want the major version from the results. Here are some example values:

    Java 1.2 uses major version 46
    Java 1.3 uses major version 47
    Java 1.4 uses major version 48
    Java 5 uses major version 49
    Java 6 uses major version 50
    Java 7 uses major version 51
    Java 8 uses major version 52
    Java 9 uses major version 53
