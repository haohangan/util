I have this table:

ip   country

1     A
2     A
3     B
4     B
4     B
I am trying to write a query, which will return something like:

A 1,2
B 3,4
E.g. SELECT * FROM table GROUP BY country returns:

A 1
B 3

SELECT country, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ip SEPARATOR ',') AS ips 
FROM my_table 
GROUP BY country



SELECT country, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ip SEPARATOR ',') AS ids 
FROM my_table

SELECT country, GROUP_CONCAT(ip)
