 All messages the client and server exchange have a channel field.
 The channel field provides the characterization of messages in classes.
 The channel is a central concept in CometD: publishers publish messages to channels,
 and subscribers subscribe to channels to receive messages.
 This is strongly reflected in the CometD APIs.


 6.2. The High Level View
CometD implements a web messaging system, in particular a web messaging system based on the publish/subscribe paradigm.

In a publish/subscribe messaging system publishers send messages,
which are characterized in classes. Subscribers express their interest in one or more classes of messages,
 and receive only messages that match the interest they have subscribed to. Senders, 
in general, have no idea which or how many recipients receive the messages they publish.
